## Introduction

Thanks for your interest in joining Us! For the next step of the interview process, we'd like for you to participate in a small project. Your task is to implement the following design and replicate it as close as possible.

## Design mockup:

## Specifications

* Each section should be have its corners rounded to 12.0px.  
* Each section should have a shadow with 5% opacity, (0, 4) offset, 10.0 radius, and #000000.  
* The separator should be half of a pixel in height (based on device scale).   
* The left & right padding of the section title should be 8px.  
* Your implementation should handle certain edge cases including (variable number of users per section, and empty sections).  
* A big part of this challenge is how well you can implement the UI details without being given the exact values of every inset, color, corner, etc. Try your best to precisely mimic the UI in the photo above.

## Minimum architecture requirement(s)
* This app should follow the multi-module architecture.
* The app must at least have two modules (articles and details)

## Minimum technical Expectation
* Minimum **85%** test coverage. (Optional)
* MVVM architecture and clean coding style.
* Use **SwiftUI** to declare user interface.
* App should support `iOS 13.0` and above.
* As a mobile engineer, you should be able to detect/prevent errors and possible edge cases.

## Next Step
Our mobile development team will review your task carefully and contact you as soon as possible.
